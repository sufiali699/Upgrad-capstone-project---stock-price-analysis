Upgrad Capstone Project BA Track - Stock Analysis and Portfolio Management

Following points summarise the expected tasks in the assignment:

1. You must use the elements of technical analysis to understand the trend of the underlying stocks. The metrics associated with risk and returns must help you realise 
   whether the security meets the criteria of your investorâ€™s financial goals.
2. You must use the metrics and the visualisations to compare the performance of the available securities against each other, and also against the market index, S&P500.
3. The findings should be aligned with the investor persona to select the appropriate stocks for the portfolio. You are expected to validate the same using the Capital 
   Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) before including the stock in the portfolio.
4. After the selection of suitable stocks, you must apply a suitable predictive model to estimate the returns from the portfolio at the end of the investment period. 
   You must check if the portfolio has the potential to fulfil the financial goals of the investor.
